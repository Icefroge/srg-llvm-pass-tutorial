Graphs from LLVM bitcode
========================

The ``opt`` tool provides handy flags for generating graphs (graphviz .dot format).
The scripts in this directory demonstrate some of the graphs that can be generated.

Make sure you have [xdotpy](https://github.com/jrfonseca/xdot.py) installed first.
You can probably find it in your distribution's repositories.
