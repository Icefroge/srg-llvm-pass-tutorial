Hello pass
==========

This is simply the Hello pass taken without modification from the LLVM
source tree. The code here really just serves to demonstrate building
an "out of tree" pass and using it as a plugin to opt.

To try it out make sure you've built and then run

```
$ run.sh
```

DO NOT RUN ``run.sh.in`` that won't work!
